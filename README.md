### NTU knowledge king

This is the final project of 110-1 programming design course offered by the department of imformation management. Students are asked to form groups of five to six to use C++ to make something. 

The goal of our group project is to create a multi-page, multiple choice question answering game. The work is divided into two parts, the game logic and pages and graphic user interface. I belonged to the game logic and page design subteam, and what I had done was to design classes to store the game information, and decide the transitions between page to page. 

This repository can be classifed into three sections:
1. file I/O: `answer.txt`, `options.txt`, `question.txt`, `user_info.txt`. The file encoding is all in utf-8.
2. supplementary material: 
    a. class說明書: explains how the class was designed
    b. 問題集: the full question, option, and answer of the game.
3. subdir: the code of the CLI game

Note that this repository only contains the CLI version of the game, the full GUI game is in another repository.
