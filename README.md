### NTU knowledge king

This is the final project of 110-1 programming design course offered by the department of imformation management. Students are asked to form groups of five to six to use C++ to make something. 

The goal of our group project is to create a multiple choice question answering game. The work is divided into two parts, the game logic and pages and graphic user interface. I belonged to the game logic and page design subteam, and what I had done was to design classes to store the game information, and decide the transitions between page to page. 

This code at this repository only contains the CLI interface at present, and our team is currently working on graphic user interface.
